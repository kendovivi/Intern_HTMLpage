        <font class='part1_article'>Anno Moyoko is an outstanding mngaka, a unique representative author of Japanese comics.<br>
        Therefore, we'd like your cooperation in bringing all of her works to the internet and translating them into multiple languages.<br>
        The first work we will e releasing is called "The Five Buffalo Girls", which has been loved by fans alike as an elusive, hard-to-find work. The data we receive from translators will be typeset into a special digital-only color version of the series. But we need everyone's help to make this a reality!<br>
        Everyone who contributes a translation to our project will receive special digital data of Anno Moyoko's illustrations as a present. The finest translations will be included in the project, and when the multilingual version of "The Five Buffalo Girls" is released, the Translators' names will appear next to the work. We will also present you with special Anno Moyoko goods to show our thanks.<br>
        We're excitedly waiting for you to join us in this worldwide project, so that we can send Anno Moyoko's works to manga fans all over the world!</font><br><br><br>

      <font class='part2_article'>In the tiny, run-down villages that tattoo this dusty expanse, there exist girls who have been sold to brothels. Day in and Day out, they battle with men's sexual desire while they try to come to terms with their own feelings and sentiments. Even prostitutes fall in love, you know. There are men who fall in love with them, too...but the freedom to love who one wishes doesn't exist in whorehouses. "Love or life. Choose one."<br>
"I choose love."<br>
"But if you die, then you can't love anyone."<br>
In a world rampant with sex and violence, how can these girls survive? One day, Candy and Suzy decide to risk their lives and escape the brothel, all for the sake of the freedom they've never had.<br>
"We're actually stronger than this."<br>
"I can hear a voice deep within my body...telling me to listen to my instincts!"<br></font>

    <font class="part4_article">Manga Reborn is a community built around the mission of increasing worldwide fans of Japanese manga artists.<br>
    Lately, fans of Japanese manga have been increasing all around the world, but since only a limited selection of manga is available in their countries, many illegal sites with uploaded copies of Japanese manga have been popping up all over the internet. We would like to proactively fight these sites, which waste the true potential of many excellent manga series, by releasing Japanese manga to the world in a way that empowers both the artists and the fans.<br>
While supporting artists in a way that has been never possible before, we're also working to create a legal place in which manga can be easily acquired by everyone, worldwide, and also create a community for fans who love manga. Through supporting manga and artists in this way, we hope to eliminate the illegal trends that have become connected with online manga, and create a new positive movement that every manga fan and author in the world can be a part of.<br>
But we need your support to do this!<br>
Let's work hard together to create an international environment where a whole new age of Japanese manga can come to life!</font><br><br>
